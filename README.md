This repository is the current state of my WeddingPlanner project.

<strong>What is it:</strong>
The idea behind this software is to create tools i missed during the planning of my own wedding.
It was very difficult to keep track of all things and also what everything costs.
This project is also a project to learn from. 

<strong>Key Features:</strong>
Create and manage tasks. Communicate with others in what needs te be done within the tasks. (WIP)
Manage budgets and payments. (Future feature)
Send invitations via Email or accept QR Code to let guest join your wedding. (Future feature)
Communicate with guests (with or without the wedding couple knowing) about wedding related information. (Future feature)
Create and manage events on the wedding day. (Future feature)
Ability to upload guest photo's when you want them and relive your perfectly planned day.

<strong>Stack:</strong>
The stack consists of Laravel 11, React 18 and TailwindCSS. For ui shadCN is used to create the ui in a simple and easy way.

<strong>Currentstate:</strong>
As of right now we are working on the TaskSystem. Tasks can be Created, Updated and deleted in or from its category. 
Categories can be created updated and deleted. Various informatie is already implemented and gets updated.
An overlay for the task has been made but in early development. 

The backend has an RBAC permission system. For now we do not use the permission system yet on the frontend.
This will updated after the taskOverlay is finished!

There is no support for mobile devices for now. This will be implemented soon.

<strong>Future:</strong>
Lots of big ideas. But none of them are completly worked out yet.
But we are planning in creating a mobile app. Which will help to get all information on a mobile device in an easy way. 
We would like to make things available offline aswell when we are working on the app.
